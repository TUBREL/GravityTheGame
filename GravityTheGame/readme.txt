Use Pygame 2.0.0
Drag the rocket to launch
avoid planets
aim for the center of the blackhole
the close to the blackhole the higher the score

There is currently only 5 levels but more can easily be created
by using the .dat file with each planet following the axis of (xcoordinate, ycoordinate, radius)

Possible improvements if more time :
More detailed GUI
Better hit detection (Using masks rather than pygame's circle hit detection)
Rocket explosion
Sound
More Graphic variety.
